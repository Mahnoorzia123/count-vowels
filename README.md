This is a beginner-friendly Python program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
It takes input from the user and checks each character to see if it’s a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).

How It Works
The user enters a string.
The program loops through each character.
If a character is a vowel (uppercase or lowercase), the counter increases.
Finally, it prints the total number of vowels.

Example Output
Enter a string: Python is fun
Number of vowels: 3

Skills Used
Loops (for)
Conditional statements (if)
String operations
Basic input/output
